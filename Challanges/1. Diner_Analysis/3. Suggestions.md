### Suggestions for the Dinner

The competitive advantage here is to give discounts for the current members. This will create the separation between core members and one-time buyers. The restaurant should look to improve at sushi dish or remove it. Having subscription will guarantee monthly income and steady customers. At the same time, look to improve or provide new versions of ramen. These recommendations are based on following findings:

Customer/member A and B spend the most, $76 and $74 respectively. However, customer B visited the restaurant most. From the six visits he got each items twice. There is no pattern however I have noticed that each new item was followed by a second try, for example, first time buying sushi next purchase was also sushi.

Items first purchased by each customer was curry. But the most sold item was ramen and from the three customers the most purchased was Ramen. The restaurant should always have ramen ready to serve faster. On the other hand, quality is important. As sushi is the least popular item the restaurant should either investigate why its not popular or just scrap sushi and focus mostly on ramen and curry. Sushi business is different than serving curry and ramen.
